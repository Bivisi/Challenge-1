              CHALLENGE - CLASSIC MINIGAMES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "Challenge" project is a little project who is made by some students
just for fun. Actually, the package includes a "Hangman Game" which is
fully functionnal with a possibility of 2 player mode. However the
project is still in development and we will maybe add some other games.
You can help if you want but remember that we work on this project only
for fun, don't take it too seriously.
