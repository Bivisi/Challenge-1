              CHALLENGE - CLASSIC MINIGAMES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "Challenge" project is a little project who is made by some students
of the UCL (Universite Catholique de Louvain) in Belgium. This project
is just for fun. Actually, the package includes a "Hangman Game" which
is fully functionnal with a possibility of 2 players mode. We also added
a "Highlow Game" which is directly linked with numbers (you have to
find the number) with also a possibility of 2 players mode. However the
project is still in development and we will add some other games.

You can help if you want but remember that we work on this project only
for fun, don't take it too seriously.
